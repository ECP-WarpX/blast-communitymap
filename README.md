This map documents [Beam, Plasma & Accelerator Simulation Toolkit (BLAST)](https://blast.lbl.gov) contributors, collaborators and users.

## Contribute to the Map

The map is open and contributable, exactly like the BLAST codes.
If you are or did use BLAST codes in your research, studies, benchmarks, ..., please consider [adding yourself to our map](https://github.com/ECP-WarpX/blast-communitymap/issues/new).

Since BLAST codes are available for everyone, without registration or strings attached, **we likely will not know BLAST is useful for you unless you reach out to us**.
BLAST development primarily relies on public funding and reviews conducted by peers and funding agencies.
**We rely on your feedback to show the community, diversity and impact of BLAST as an open science ecosystem for beam, plasma and accelerator modeling.**


## References for Citations

Another important way to give back to the BLAST community is by properly citing BLAST codes in your works, see for example the guidance for:
